# Cyberhead

Bomb Rush Cyberfunk proof of concept VR mod.

## What works

- Looking around
- Moving around (somewhat)
  - Teleports, deaths, grinding, etc. are very janky
- Some controller input
  - Move around (left stick)
  - Snap turn (right stick)
  - Jump (right controller primary)
  - Switch movestyle (right controller secondary)
  - Manual/slide (right controller trigger)
  - Boost (right controller grip)
- Hand IK (somewhat)
  - Hands are rotated wrongly
  - Sometimes they just give up

## What doesn't work

- The HUD
- The main menu, cutscenes, phone, etc. (anything that isn't normal gameplay)
  - Use the desktop or [QuickLaunch](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/LazyDuchess/QuickLaunch/) to get into game
- Slop Crew integration

## Credits

- VR DLLs sourced from a random Unity project I built on my PC (sorry for no trustable source)
- Lots of learning what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing from [LCVR](https://github.com/DaXcess/LCVR)
- Patcher code from [universal-unity-vr](https://github.com/Raicuparta/universal-unity-vr)
- Seagate for having my hard drive die halfway through making this
