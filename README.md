# Cyberhead

Bomb Rush Cyberfunk proof of concept VR mod.

> [!WARNING]
> This mod is a proof of concept with lots of bugs. It will be laggy, behave strangely, and will break things. Once I iron everything out, I'll upload it to Thunderstore.

## What works

- Looking around
- Moving around (somewhat)
  - Teleports are janky and you may clip out of bounds when changing levels
- Some controller input
  - Move around (left stick)
  - Snap turn (right stick)
  - Jump (right controller primary)
  - Switch movestyle (right controller secondary)
  - Manual/slide (right controller trigger)
  - Boost (right controller grip)
  - Trick (right controller primary/secondary/stick pressed)
- Hand IK (somewhat)
  - Hands are rotated wrongly
  - Sometimes they just give up
- The HUD (somewhat)
- Slop Crew integration (somewhat)
  - Very buggy and unreliable, suggested to not use if not in VR
- Flatscreen UI in menus (somewhat)
  - Only tested on the outfit changing screen
  - Swirl shader is broken

## What doesn't work

- Seeing your head
  - I call it "Faux Mode"
- Any inputs not currently bound
  - Talking to NPCs, doing graffiti
  - The phone
  - Dancing
- The main menu, cutscenes, phone, etc. (anything that isn't normal gameplay)
  - Use the desktop or [QuickLaunch](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/LazyDuchess/QuickLaunch/) to get into game
